restructured sc0010 to try to make use of comms to assign roles to robots
so that robots would remain in those roles each turn. 

Every even soldier spawned is a scout, every other a "miner".

Miners used to mine, nut now they just guard (as they were getting picked off while mining).

When clock reaches 600 (if the game gets that far)... all miners become scouts and charge 
on mass at enemy HQ.
